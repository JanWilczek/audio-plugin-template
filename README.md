# üê∫ WolfSound's Audio Plugin Template

![Cmake workflow success badge](https://github.com/JanWilczek/audio-plugin-template/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

Want to create an audio plugin (e.g., a VST3 plugin) with C++ but don't know how to go about?

Heard about the [JUCE C++ framework](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) but not sure how to start a JUCE project?

Want to use CMake with JUCE but don't know how?

Want to be able to easily integrate third-party C++ libraries to your project?

Want to unit test your audio plugin?

Want to ensure maximum safety of your software?

And all this with a click of a button?

Well, this template allows you to immediately start your JUCE C++ framework audio plugin project with a CMake-based project structure. It involves

* clear repo structure
* C++ 23 standard
* effortless handling of third-party dependencies with the CPM package manager; use the C++ libraries you want together with JUCE
* highest warning level and "treat warnings as errors"
* ready-to-go unit test project with GoogleTest

Additionally

* continuous integration made easy with Github actions: build and run tests on the main branch and on every pull request
* automatic clang-format on C++ files run on every commit; don't worry about code formatting anymore!

I am personally using this template all the time.

Feel free to propose suggestions üòâ

## Usage

This is a template repository which means you can right click "Use this template" on GitHub and create your own repo out of it.

After cloning it locally, you can proceed with the usual CMake workflow.

In the main repo directory execute

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
```

The first run will take the most time because the dependencies (CPM, JUCE, and googletest) need to be downloaded.

Alternatively, you can use bundled CMake presets:

```bash
$ cmake --preset default # uses the Ninja build system
$ cmake --build build
$ ctest --preset default
```

Existing presets are `default`, `release`, and `Xcode`.

To run clang-format on every commit, in the main directory execute

```bash
pre-commit install
```

(for this you may need to install `pre-commit` with `pip`: `pip install pre-commit`).

Don't forget to change "YourPluginName" to, well, your plugin name everywhere üòâ

## How was this template built?

See how I create this template step by step in this video:

[![Audio plugin template tutorial video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Uq7Hwt18s3s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq7Hwt18s3s "Audio plugin template tutorial video")

## CLion Setup
You can follow these steps in order to use this template with the CLion IDE:

1. Download or clone the template to your computer.
2. Open CLion and from the Welcome screen press `CMD + SHIFT + A`, enter "Open", and choose the CMakeLists.txt located in the root of the template. In the dialog that opens, click `Open as Project`.
3. Build the template by clicking on `build` in the main menu.
4. Upon the first project loading, CLion automatically detects 10 run/debug configuration associated with the project. If you go to `Run | Edit Configurations` it will show the list of these 10 run/debug configurations.
5. In the `AudioPlugin_VST3` configuration you should set the value of the "Executable" parameter to the file path of your DAW's executable binary file. For example if you're using Ableton Live on a Mac, the binary is found at this path "/Applications/Ableton Live 11 Suite.app/Contents/MacOS".
6. Now when you run `AudioPlugin_VST3` it will open up your DAW.
7. You will be able to find the "hello world" plugin under your list of plugins under `/MyCompany/YourPluginName`.
