if (CMAKE_GENERATOR STREQUAL Xcode)
# On macOS arm64, all binaries have to be signed before running. In local development, the linker adds an ad-hoc placeholder signature. In Xcode however, the ad-hoc signature is delayed until after the “Run Script” build phase, so the POST_BUILD command added by gtest_discover_tests cannot run. Thus, we need to delay test discovery until run time.
